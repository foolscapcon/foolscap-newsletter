We enjoyed sharing music so much at this year’s Foolscap that we’ve made it a regular event! Join us on Thursday, March 25 from 7-9 p.m. PDT and listen in at the following Zoom link:

This week’s playlist theme is covers: songs you know, sung by surprisingly different artists. Steven Stadnicki has put together an hour-long playlist to start us off, and we hope you’ll bring links to some of your favorite cover songs to share in the second half!

This will be a recurring two-hour event on the last Thursday of every month, switching things up from our weekly Virtual Game Night in that timeslot.
