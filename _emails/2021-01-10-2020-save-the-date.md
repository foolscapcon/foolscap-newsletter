# Foolscap 2021: “We Can Make It”!
Yes, friends, there IS a 2021 Foolscap! Save the dates of Friday, Feb. 12 and Saturday, Feb. 13, for a Zoom- and Discord-based online convention. Our theme is “We Can Make It” and we’ll be focusing on what people have been crafting, cooking, writing, reading, and enjoying during the difficult past year. Expect to see a few of our past GoHs appear to tell you about what they’ve been doing (books, serials, artworks, and more).

## Get Involved with Planning Jan. 17th
As always, we’d like to involve you in the planning. Please mark Sunday, January 17, 3 p.m.- 5 p.m. on your calendar for the convention programming meeting.

# Finding What You’re Looking For": a panel on libraries and online resources on Sat., Jan. 16th, 6-7 PST
We’re all stuck at home, but we still need books, entertainment, and other information. How can we find what we need now that we’re online so much? Our panel of librarians answers these questions and many more you may not have realized you could even ask!
