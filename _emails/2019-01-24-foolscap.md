### Selected Descriptions

#### BYOM - Bring Your Own Music
We also really enjoyed last year’s music party, and we’d like to do it again. Please be on the lookout for songs to bring to our BYOM event on Friday night. We’ll provide some snacks and you bring the tunes.

#### Open Space Generation

Do you have some good ideas for panel discussions? Did another con have a panel that left all the questions unanswered? Did you discover something amazing this year that everyone needs to know more about? Do you have nebulous ideas that only intelligent conversation will bring into the light? Do you have a rant that needs honing? Bring these ideas to to Foolscap and present them at the program planning sessions. (You can present them in person or just turn them in for others to read).
