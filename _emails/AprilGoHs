While you have some time at home, do you need some books to pile on top of your TBR pile? Of course you do! Here are some recent works by some of Foolscap's past Guests of Honors.

We'll start with congratulating the authors of the Hugo nominations! [CoNZealand](https://conzealand.nz/about/explore-worldcon/world-science-fiction-society-about/hugo-awards) released the finalists and we had several GoH's on the list, appearing once, twice or (amazingly!) three times. CoNZealand has recently gone virtual and at this time are still figuring out the details, but you can vote for the winners with either a supporting or attending membership. 

T. Kingfisher, AKA Ursula Vernon, has Minor Mage up for a Lodestar.

Seananâ€™s InCryptid series is up for Best Series.

Ted Chiang, Omphalos is up for Novelette.

Ted Chiang also has "Anxiety Is the Dizziness of Freedom" up for a Novella
