### Thank You For Attending
We at Foolscap, and particularly I as Captain, want to thank all our members for coming and making it a great weekend. You brought energy, ideas, music and creativity, which made for a lovely weekend of conversations, recommendations, learning, and laughing. Special thanks to Judy and Beth who brought the comfortable chairs for our commons.

### Applause For GoH Seanan McGuire
Seanan brought the spirit of Foolscap to her panel and participation. Her masterful story telling brought us to tears of
laughter and amazed us with the depth of research, education, and legendary book collection that goes into each book. The 
singing was an extra bonus that she shared with us.
