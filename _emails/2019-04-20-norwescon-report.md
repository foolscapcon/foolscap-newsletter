### Past GoH Gossip

So what have past Foolscap GoH's been up to lately? Well, Seanan McGuire has her Spider-Gwen comics (inquire at your local comic shop). Her latest book, *Middlegame*, came out in May. Wearing her other author hat, Mira Grant's *Alien: Echo* is in stores now and Subterranean Press is putting out *In the Shadow of Spindrift House* later in June. 

Patricia Brigg's latest Mercy book, *Storm Cursed*, came out in May, as did Ted Chiang's *Exhalation: Stories*. Michael Kaluta's comic adaption of *The Abyss* gets a new edition to celebrate the 30 year annivery of the movie.

Nancy Perl was a GoH at Norwescon last month, and I caught her talk on how to recommend books. Anyone else catch up with her there?
