### Past GoH Gossip

So what have past Foolscap GoH been up to lately? Well, Seanan McGuire has her SpiderGwen comics (#10 should be at your local comic shop). That Ain't Witchcraft, the latest InCryptid book, came out in March. Wearing her other hat, Mira Grant's Alien: Echo is in stores now. And another McGuire book, Middlegame, comes out in May.

Patricia Brigg's latest Mercy book, Storm Curse, also comes out in May.

Nancy Perl was a GoH at Norwescon last week, and I caught her talk on how to recommend books.
