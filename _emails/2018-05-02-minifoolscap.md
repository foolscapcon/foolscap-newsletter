### Mini-Foolscap on May 20th in Kent

Mini-Foolscaps are held in an afternoon and are a fun chance to talk with friends and show off our Foolscap Flavor. We hold a mini-panel, then brainstorm a bit, then discuss whatever we've come up with. The introductory topic this month is "Spoilers: When, Why, and How", inspired by the huge discussion about where people can discuss the latest Marvel installment.

The May Mini-Foolscap will be held in the main Kent Library on May 20th from 1:30 - 4:00.
