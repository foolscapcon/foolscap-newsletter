### Mini-Foolscap on Sunday May 20th at Kent Library

Mini-Foolscaps are held in an afternoon and are a fun chance to talk with friends and show off our Foolscap Flavor. We hold a mini-panel, then brainstorm a bit, then discuss whatever we've come up with. The introductory topic this month is "Spoilers: When, Why, and How", inspired by the huge discussion about where people can discuss the latest Marvel installment.

We also have an exciting announcement to make, come hear it in person.

The May Mini-Foolscap will be held in the main [Kent Library](https://kcls.org/locations/1520/) on May 20th from 1:30 - 4:00.

### Foolscap 2019 Feb 1-3. Put Us On Your Calendar!
Foolscap 2019 will run from Feb 1-3, 2019 in the Hilton Seattle Airport. You heard it here twice!
