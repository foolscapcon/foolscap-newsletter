### Foolscap Announces Nancy Kress as the 2019 Guest of Honor

We are delighted to welcome author Nancy Kress as our GoH in 2019. 

From her Bio:

> [Nancy Kress](https://nancykress.com) is the author of thirty-three books, including twenty-six novels, four collections of short stories, and three books on writing.  Her work has won six Nebulas, two Hugos, a Sturgeon, and the John W. Campbell Memorial Award.  Her most recent work is TERRAN TOMORROW, the conclusion of her YESTERDAY’S KIN series. Like much of her work, this series concerns genetic engineering.  Kress’s fiction has been translated into Swedish, Danish, French, Italian, German, Spanish, Polish, Croatian, Chinese, Lithuanian, Romanian, Japanese, Korean, Hebrew, Russian, and Klingon, none of which she can read.  In addition to writing, Kress often teaches at various venues around the country and abroad, including a visiting lectureship at the University of Leipzig, a 2017 writing class in Beijing, and the annual intensive workshop Tao Toolbox, which she teaches every summer with Walter Jon Williams.


From a personal standpoint, I remember Kress as my first Hugo pick. I read "Beggers in Spain" and thought: "This is the kind of thing that should win an award." It then picked up the Hugo and Nebula for Best Novella. Hmm, I thought, maybe these Hugo people know something...

For an added bonus, Nancy comes with [Jack Skillingstead](https://www.jackskillingstead.com/), her husband and a writer in his own right, with three novels and over forty short stories to his bibliography.
