### Sign up for Saturday Writing Workshops

Foolscap offers Writing Workshops Saturday at 10 a.m. and Saturday at 2 p.m.). If you have a Foolscap membership, workshops are free — but space is limited, so you must pre-register. The 2019 workshops are:

* Journaling for Writers and Other Creatives: How to make a system that works for you (Instructor: A.J. Hackwith)

* Writing Tight But Epic: How to Make and Break Empires in 50,000 Words or Less (Instructor: Spencer Ellsworth)	

Visit the workshop page at Foolscap.org to register for the workshops and see detailed session descriptions and instructor bios.


### Planning to Propose Some Panels?

Please do! For example, our panelist Nancy Kress talked about her new book on Scalzi’s [Big Idea](https://whatever.scalzi.com/2018/11/13/the-big-idea-nancy-kress-5/) and now I’m thinking about discussing genetic ethics in SF. See you at the planning session on Saturday!


### Reminder: Book Your Room!

All this is happening at the Sea-Tac Hilton. It’s time to book your rooms! Use code Foolscap19 to get our [special rate](https://book.passkey.com/go/foolscap2019).
