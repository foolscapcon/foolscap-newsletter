# Foolscap 2021
Foolscap takes our DIY aesthetic online for 2021. We take a look at what people have written and read, crafted and cooked, and learned and enjoyed over the challenging year behind us. Join past GOHs and some new guests to see and hear what they've been working on, plus maybe share what you've accomplished!

## A Puppet Shows You How to Look Your Best on Zoom 
Look your best on a Zoom call or panel — not with fancy backgrounds but with body language that will help you communicate clearly and appropriately—and entertainingly—to everyone who is watching. Novelist, puppeteer, and writing instructor Mary Robinette Kowal will demonstrate and take questions.

## You Can Dance If You Want To - a Foolscap music social

Been to any good concerts lately? Neither have we - but that doesn’t mean it’s been a bad year for music! We’re putting together a playlist of new music discoveries we’ve made in 2020, and inviting you to share the music you’ve found during our year in quarantine, along with some of the songs that helped you make it through. This will be a mics-off, text-based conversation, to let us focus on the music. If you’ve got music to share, bringing a Bandcamp or Youtube link will help!


## Creating and Publishing Serials
Serialized fiction is enjoying a revival online in podcasts and websites. Mark Ferrari (*Twice: The Serial*) and Curtis Chen (*Ninth Step Station*) are at forefront of this trend. They’ll talk about the challenges of writing and publishing serials and take some questions.

## Cooking Demo: Dutch Babies
You may not be able to have Hospitality’s Dutch babies this year, but we’ll gladly show you how to make your own! Make sure you have eggs, milk, flour, sugar, butter, and either a cast-iron skillet or 9x9ish glass or ceramic baking dish. We’ll give you the recipe, some techniques, and a few general kitchen tips along the way!

## Virtual Teas and Tools
Stefanie and Wing answer your questions about brewing and serving tea, talk a bit about its long history, and show off some of their more unusual blends and brewing tools.
