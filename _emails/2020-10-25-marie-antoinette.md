subject: "Foolscap Online: Marie Antoinette Memorial Masquerade on Thursday"
---

Come join us online at 7:00 P.M. on Thursday, October 29th for the Third Semi-Annual Marie Antoinette Memorial Masquerade.

Wear your best costume — from the neck up! Makeup, hats, hairstyles, jewelry and whatever else is visible strictly above the shoulders is all that counts, as befits this event’s famous namesake. In keeping with the spirit of our telepresent year, virtual costumes are welcome! Swap spooky stories, trade pumpkin pie recipes, find out what your fellow Foolscapians have been up to… We won’t even mind if you eat cake. Prizes await those who show off the best & most creative costumes.

This virtual meet-up will be on our Discord server. (If you don’t have a Discord account, making one is as simple as going to https://discord.com/app and following the directions.) Once you have an account, you’ll be able to visit our invite link at https://discord.gg/jpjCQsR to access Foolscap events and permanent chat channels there. We’ve also posted some quick hints at https://www.foolscap.org/discord-overview/ to help get you get familiar.
