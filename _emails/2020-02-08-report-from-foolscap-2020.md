# 🚀Captain's Log, Stardate 48634.44, USS Foolscap (ANS-42)🚀
Thanks for coming to Foolscap 2020!  It wouldn't have been possible without all the great members.  I would like to send special thanks out to Cherie, Karen, Tom, Jeff, Beth, Steven, Jeff, Jason, Wing, Stephanie, Lile, Kathleen, Alexander, Manny, Edd, Theresa, Nicole.  

I expect 2021 to be even better, and I signed on for another year to help make that happen.

In for a penny, in for a pound!

## Cabaret🥳

Our brand new Foolscap Cabaret was a hit! Definitely watch for this to return next year. Wing and Jason co-MCed while filkers and storytellers took the stage. Our Guest of Honor read a short story about aliens and iron lungs. Tom Whitmore pelted the audience with trivia questions, then pelted correct answerers with candy. In the midst of it all we held the Auction -- a sword, a magnificent trophy (or was it a milkshake cup?), a tri-dimensional chess set and another wacky hat were among the items sent home with the highest bidder. Rounds of "I've Got a Secret" hosted and moderated by Dave Howell carried us into the night.
