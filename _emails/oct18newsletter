### Changes For Foolscap 2019

We’ve been listening to feedback, and in 2019 we are going to preplan some of the panels, especially for Friday night and early Saturday, and then Open Source much of the rest of the convention.

A great advantage of preplanning is more panels that require preparation.  Foolscap members include many skilled creators and we’d love to have a chance to show some of this off. If you’d like to host a Maker Panel that demonstrates a skill or craft we’d love to hear from you — maybe a fiber art? Jewelry? Some of these lends themselves to a bit of audience participation — let us know if you want us to supply some materials!



### Friday Bring Your Own Music!

We also really enjoyed last year’s music party, and we’d like to do it again. Please be on the lookout for songs to bring to our Bring Your Own Music even on Friday night. We’ll provide some snacks and you bring the tunes. 


### Book Your Room!

All this is happening at the Sea-Tac Hilton. It’s time to book your rooms! Use code Foolscap19 to get our [special rate](https://book.passkey.com/go/foolscap2019).
