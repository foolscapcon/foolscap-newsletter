# Foolscap Presents: The Killer Bs on Writing in Asimov’s Foundation Universe.
This past year, Isaac Asimov’s [_Foundation_](https://www.worldcat.org/title/foundation/oclc/1962368/editions?referer=di&editionsView=true) was adapted to the screen and the first season released on Apple TV. The original novels were published 70 years ago. In the late 1990s, Greg Bear, Gregory Benford, and David Brin each wrote a new novel in the Second Foundation Trilogy, continuing Asimov’s story. While they didn’t collaborate in writing their own books, they did collaborate in creating the story arc.
We will be talking with The Killer Bs about their experience writing in someone else’s universe, how they created the story arc for the new trilogy, and their reactions to the screen version of Asimov’s vision.

# Show & Tell Panel: Your Favorite Recipe
We're opening the floor to anyone who wants to show off a favorite recipe to their fellow members. You'll have a few minutes to present your dish and talk about the preparation and what's so great about it.
Please prepare your item beforehand! You won't be assembling it from scratch on stream. We only need a summary, and maybe a demonstration of any tricky parts.
Send your submission via email to [programming@foolscap.org](mailto:programming@foolscap.org) so we can track and schedule everyone.
