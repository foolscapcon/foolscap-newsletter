### Foolscap 2019 - Coming of Age:

Foolscap is turning 21 this year! As such, our theme is Coming of Age
and we’ll have special events and panels around the pleasures of being
ADULT. Drinking, gambling, paying bills, laughing at yourself,
everything that makes maturity grand.

(Don’t worry if your ID signals that your age falls short — generous
members have donated spare years that we can issue for the duration of
the con.)

### Bring New Friends to Foolscap

If you have a friend who would be a great Foolscap Member, invite them along! Remember that our Student Membership applies both to students (attending college or schools) and to First Time Members (Students of Foolscap). So newcomers can join our convention for $25.


### Today is the Last Day to Book Your Room

time to book your rooms! Use code Foolscap19 to get our [special
