### Foolscap 2019 - Coming of Age:

Foolscap is turning 21 this year! As such, our theme is Coming of Age
and we’ll have special events and panels around the pleasures of being
ADULT. Drinking, gambling, paying bills, laughing at yourself,
everything that makes maturity grand.

(Don’t worry if your ID signals that your age falls short — generous
members have donated spare years that we can issue for the duration of
the con.)
