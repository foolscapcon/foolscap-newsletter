### Captain's Log, Stardate 47634.44, USS Foolscap (ANS-42)
Thanks!

I had a great time at Foolscap 2019, and I appreciate all of you who helped make it a great weekend. Particular thanks to Nancy Kress, our wonderful GoH who really embraced the spirit of Foolscap. I had good discussions, learned some things, picked up some good books and even more good book recommendations, and even managed to put in a few puzzle pieces.

It was a privilege and a pleasure to serve you as Captain for the past two years. I‚Äôm handing on the Captaincy to Doug Beal, who makes everything work better, so I‚Äôm expecting to enjoy Foolscap 2020 even more. See you all next year!

### Foolscap 2020 - Save the Date - Feb 7-9
Foolscap 2020 will return to the Hilton Seattle Airport on the second weekend in February (7th through 9th). 

### Applause for Nancy Kress
We‚Äôd like to thank Nancy Kress for her graceful turn as Foolscap Guest of Honor. She managed to out-Foolscap Foolscap with her reading and ensuing discussion of the roles of stories in affirming or challenging our ethical worldviews. As fitting for our theme of Coming of Age, Nancy provides a great example of adulthood both in her works and in her personality. I hope I grow up to be cool like her!
