Thanks!

I had a great time at Foolscap 2019, and I appreciate all of you who helped make it a great weekend. Particular thanks to Nancy Kress, our wonderful GoH who really embraced the spirit of Foolscap. I had good discussions, learned some things, picked up some good books and even more good book recommendations, and even managed to put in a few puzzle pieces.

It was a privilege and a pleasure to serve you as Captain for the past two years. I’m handing on the Captaincy to Doug Beal, who makes everything work better, so I’m expecting to enjoy Foolscap 2020 even more. See you all next year!
