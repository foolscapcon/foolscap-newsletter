### ‚úçÔ∏èWriting Workshops

Foolscap writing workshops are free with your Foolscap membership. To reserve your spot, email workshop@foolscap.com

Friday afternoon workshop [2:30 to 5:00] : ‚ÄúTwo Heads, Four Hands, One Story‚Äù ‚Äî Find out how working (and selling) writers have collaborated. Three writers discuss their experience writing both short stories and novels, and provide several exercises that will get you working together. Instructors: Manny Frishberg, Amy Thomson and Edd Vick 

Saturday afternoon workshop [2:00 to 4:30]: ‚ÄúMake Magic: Write, then Read It Aloud ‚Äî a Workshop with Two Hour Transport‚Äù ‚Äî There‚Äôs something magical about reading new work aloud. In the first hour of this workshop you will read a short story by a well-known author and write a piece of flash fiction, or a longer scene, that responds to the story in some way. In the second half of the workshop you will perform what you have written and we will give you guidance on how to use the mic, proper posture, and eye contact. Participants should expect to come ready to read, write, and perform.
Instructors: Nicole Bade and Theresa J. Barker
