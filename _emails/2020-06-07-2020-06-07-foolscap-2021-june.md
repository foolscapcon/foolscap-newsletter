Bottom line. Foolscap will happen in 2021, online or in person.

Safety first. Even if public health regulations allow large gatherings in February 2021, we know that many Foolscap members are in high-risk groups. We’re committed to producing convention activities for everyone, so we are making plans to allow people who cannot be there in-person to be a part of the convention online.

Planning. We’re working with the hotel to talk about what they are expecting for February, and we’ll keep you updated on that.

Exploring online options. Several conventions, including the Nebulas, Balticon, and Worldcon were completely online this year. We’re looking at which technologies worked best for their online members (and which didn’t). Our goal is to see how their successes with panels, parties, readings, dealers rooms, art shows, dances and music could be adapted for Foolscap.

Foolscap, always. We are prioritizing the things Foolscap does best: bringing people together, sparking interesting conversations, and taking chances with new ideas. We’ll learn how it works together.

Join us. We’re going to experiment with some online Foolscap events between now and February. Want to help out? Let us know!
