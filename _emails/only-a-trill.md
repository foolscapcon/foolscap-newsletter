## This Is Only a Drill

Currently we still plan and hope to host a Foolscap in February 2020. But the past few months have taught us all that life changes fast. Many spring and summer conventions had to pivot at breakneck pace to go virtual. If conditions make it unsafe to hold our usual convention, we'd still like to have our Foolscap experience. But first we need to learn a lot of things!

We're thinking of holding a Virtual Mini-Foolscap, perhaps in September. We'd have a brief panel, then choose the followup panel in our open-space way. Meanwhile we'd have a commons open for chatting and hospitality. It would be an opportunity for us to see each other and to test-drive the technology (probably Zoom and Discord). What do you think? Are you interested in a brief (two hour) Virtual Foolscap evening?
