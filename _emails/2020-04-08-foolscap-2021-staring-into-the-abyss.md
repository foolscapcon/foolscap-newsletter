# Dear Foolscap Members
These are worrying times, and we are committed to keeping both our members and the Foolscap tradition alive.  We are monitoring Washington State official announcements and other conventions.  Stay Safe, Wash Your Hands, and Know Where Your Towel Is!

# Staying Safe and Sane

## Honoring Our Past Guests of Honor

Speaking of staying sane while you have time at home, do you need some books to pile on top of your Read Next Pile? Of course you do! Here are some recent works by some of Foolscap's past Guests of Honors.

We'll start with congratulating the authors of the Hugo nominations! [CoNZealand](https://conzealand.nz/about/explore-worldcon/world-science-fiction-society-about/hugo-awards) released the finalists and we had several GoH's on the list, appearing once, twice or (amazingly!) three times. CoNZealand has recently gone virtual and at this time are still figuring out the details, but you can vote for the winners with either a supporting or attending membership. 

### Best Novel
- *Middlegame* by Seanan McGuire

### Best Novella
- *In An Absent Dream* by Seanan McGuire (double!) **AND** "Anxiety is the Dizziness of Freedom" by Ted Chiang 

### Best Novelette
- "Omphalos" by Ted Chiang (double!)

### Best Series

### Lodestar Award for Best YA (not a Hugo)
