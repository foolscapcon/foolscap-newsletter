# Schedule
The preliminary Foolscap schedule is now [available on our website](https://www.foolscap.org/foolscap-2020-schedule/). Weâ€™ll be updating it with more details over the next few days, but take a look now, and start thinking about the events you want to be a part of!

Weâ€™re running more programming on Friday and Sunday, so plan to be here the whole weekend for panels on topics from writing flash fiction to creating tarot decks, exploring the secrets of cities, origami, great new books, and more! Plus two tea-times, an evening cabaret, and more than fifteen hours of programming weâ€™ll be planning together when we get there!

# Workshop 
Sunday is the deadline to register for one or both of the Foolscap writers workshops:

Two Heads, Four Hands, One Story: Co-authoring fiction (instructors: Manny Frishberg, Amy Thomson, and Edd Vick). Friday, Feb. 7, 2-4:30 p.m.

Reading Your Work Aloud (instructors: Theresa Barker and Nicole Bade of Two Hour Transport). Saturday, Feb. 8, 2-4:30 p.m.

To register, simply send your name and workshop choices to [workshop@foolscap.org](mailto:workshop@foolscap.org). Workshops are free to convention members. Youâ€™ll find more details on the workshops here: [https://www.foolscap.org/workshops/](https://www.foolscap.org/workshops/)

# Parking at the Hotel
Our parking rate with the Hotel is $12.  After a new City of SeaTac fee ($3.25), and sales tax (10%), the total is $16.78.

# Hotel Discount Code Closed Early
The Hotel discount code closed one day too early. If you ran into this problem, make a normal reservation and forward it to [hotel@foolscap.org](mailto:hotel@foolscap.org).  The hotel will then apply the Foolscap rate.
