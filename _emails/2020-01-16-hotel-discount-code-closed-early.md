# Parking at Hotel
Our parking rate with the Hotel is 12$.  After a new City of Seattle fee ($3.25), and sales tax (10%), the total is $16.78.

# Hotel Discount Code Closed Early
The Hotel discount code closed one day too early. If you ran into this problem, make a normal reservation and forward it to [hotel@foolscap.org](mailto:hotel@foolscap.org).  The hotel will then apply the Foolscap rate.
