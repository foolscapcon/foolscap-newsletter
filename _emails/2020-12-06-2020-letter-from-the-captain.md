# Foolscap 2021 Will be Virtual
Hello Foolscapians,

We were fortunate that Foolscap 2020 landed before the Pandemic exploded. Unfortunately we we are now in the middle of the Pandemic, and the only safe way forward is with a virtual convention.

A virtual Foolscap will be very different, but with your participation I'm confident we can bring Foolscap into the future

I miss y'all,

Douglas Beal, Foolscap 2021 Captain


# Sad News 
Foolscap is sad to announce the loss of Amy Carpenter (AmyCat), who has been Foolscap’s main bookseller for many years. She passed away in mid-November.

Based in Oregon, AmyCat was part of the dealers rooms at LosCon, Orycon, Norwescon, Westercon, and other West Coast Conventions. She was known for featuring the works of emerging writers and for taking books from indie publishers and small publishers on consignment. In short, she contributed tremendously to the community. As Alys Meghan Cattwyn she was also a member of the SCA, where she was renowned for her work in sewing. It is difficult to imagine a Foolscap without AmyCat’s booth in the corner.
